      <h5>AIM AND SCOPE OF WEBSITE</h5>
      <p id="fruitspara" class="para">
        The world we see nowadays is becoming more digitalized. In this digitalized world e-commerce is taking the
        ascendancy by making products available within the reach of customers where the customer doesn't have to go out
        of their house for shopping. As now a day's people are relying on online products so the importance of a review
        is going higher. For selecting a product, a customer needs to go through thousands of reviews to understand a
        product. But in this prospering day of machine learning, going through thousands of reviews would be much easier
        if a model is used to polarize those reviews and learn from it. We will use Sentimental Analysis method on a
        large scale dataset to polarize it and get the rankings of products by filters for easy shopping experience to
        user.

      <h5>ABSTRACT OF THE WEBSITE</h5>
      <p id="computerpara" class="para">
        The lack of buying product via online are the consumer cannot touch, try, or even see it directly. Then how does
        the consumer believe the product they like, is the correct product to be bought. The main key is product review
        from the consumer who have bought and try the product. The more number of product review on certain product or
        the popular product caused difficulties for the consumer to decide which product they should choose. For that we
        require a solution, which is the we will apply sentiment analysis to classify every product review into positive
        orientation, negative or neutral and also produce summary of product review based on product feature to help
        reading process, product review and decision making.
